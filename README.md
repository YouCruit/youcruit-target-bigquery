### Utilizing partitioned tables in BigQuery

Enabling partitioned data on your destination table can, depending on your data, reduce the amount of
data (and thus cost) needed to be queried on each batch. The partition column must be a timestamp
and it must remain constant over time. A creation-timestamp is usually a good choice.

To take advantage of this feature use either
`default_partition_column` or `table_configs` setting.

A full example meltano config is as follows:

```yaml
loaders:
- name: target-bigquery
  config:
    project_id: <PROJ-ID>
    location: <LOCATION>
    dataset: <DATASET>
    table_prefix: ${MELTANO_EXTRACT__LOAD_SCHEMA}_
    batch_size: 10000
    ## No partioning by default
    # default_partition_column:
    table_configs:
    ## All hubspot streams have a createdAt property we can use.
    ## We are using the fact that all table names will be prefixed with the tap name
    ## thanks to the table_prefix setting above
    - table_prefix: tap_hubspot_
      partition_column: createdAt
    ## Here we specify a specific stream and what partition column is correct
    - table_name: tap_postgres_public-e_users
      partition_column: date_created
```

If neither of `table_prefix` and `table_name` matches then `default_partition_column` is used as fallback.

If the resulting `partition_column` is false, either by being `None` (the default) or an empty string, then
no partioning will be performed.

Also note that the target will not perform any `ALTER TABLE` operations. Only tables being created for the first
time will be partitioned.

### Configure using environment variables

This Singer target will automatically import any environment variables within the working directory's
`.env` if the `--config=ENV` is provided, such that config values will be considered if a matching
environment variable is set either in the terminal context or in the `.env` file.

### Google authentication

Google authentication is done by providing a path to a service account JSON file in the environment variable
`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`

## Usage

You can easily run `target-bigquery` by itself or in a pipeline using [Meltano](https://meltano.com/).

### Executing the Target Directly

```bash
target-bigquery --version
target-bigquery --help
# Test using the "Carbon Intensity" sample:
tap-carbon-intensity | target-bigquery --config /path/to/target-bigquery-config.json
```

## Developer Resources

Follow these instructions to contribute to this project.

### Initialize your Development Environment

```bash
pipx install poetry
poetry install
```

### Create and Run Tests

Create tests within the `target_bigquery/tests` subfolder and
  then run:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

You can also test the `target-bigquery` CLI interface directly using `poetry run`:

```bash
poetry run target-bigquery --help
```

### Testing with [Meltano](https://meltano.com/)

_**Note:** This target will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.
Examples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._

Next, install Meltano (if you haven't already) and any needed plugins:

```bash
# Install meltano
pipx install meltano
# Initialize meltano within this directory
cd target-bigquery
meltano install
```

Now you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:

```bash
# Test invocation:
meltano invoke target-bigquery --version
# OR run a test `elt` pipeline with the Carbon Intensity sample tap:
meltano elt tap-carbon-intensity target-bigquery
```

develop your own Singer taps and targets.
